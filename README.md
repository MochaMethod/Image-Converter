# Image-Converter
Changes the names / file extensions of one or several images.

Places unconverted images in their own sub-folder.

This script was originally written to ease the process of converting heightmap images from .png to .raw files for use in the Unity engine, as I had several terrains all with their own heightmap, and processing each image on their own was time-consuming.  

# Instructions
  1. Place this script inside of the folder that contains your image files.
  2. Double click the file, or launch it via console with `python ConvertFiles.py`.
  3. Enter the first few letters of the desired file(s) you want to convert.
  4. Enter the desired file type you wish to convert the image to.
  5. Enter the length at which you want the file name to be shortened to (Note: Enter 0 to keep the same name).
